Changelog for s6.

In 2.7.0.0
----------

 - s6-ftrigrd and s6lockd internally use the textclient API/ABI
instead of skaclient. This is cleaner, faster code.


In 2.6.2.0
----------

 - Bugfixes.
 - New functions: s6_fdholder_start() and s6_fdholder_end().


In 2.6.1.1
----------

 - Bugfixes.


In 2.6.1.0
----------

 - Bugfixes.
 - Addition of the s6_svc_lock_take() and s6_svc_lock_release()
functions, to fix a race condition in s6-rc.
 - New program: s6-notifyoncheck, to implement polling for
readiness and reroute the result into the s6 readiness notification
mechanism.


In 2.6.0.0
----------

 - Bugfixes. One of the bugfixes required a visible ABI change,
which explains the major version bump.
 - Documentation fixes.


In 2.5.1.0
----------

 - Bugfixes.
 - s6-ftrig-listen1 now prints to stdout the last event (the last
byte) it received and made it match the regexp it was given.
 - s6-supervise now recognizes the "timeout-kill" file in a service
directory. If this file exists and contains a nonzero integer t,
the behaviour of a "s6-svc -d" command is changed from
"send a SIGTERM and a SIGCONT" to "send a SIGTERM and a SIGCONT,
then if the service is still not dead after t milliseconds, send
a SIGKILL".


In 2.5.0.0
----------

 - Added this NEWS file. :)
 - Major types overhaul to make them more POSIXly correct:
compatibility with skalibs-2.5.0.0.
 - Services can now report permanent failure by having a ./finish
script exit 125.
 - s6-svwait, s6-svlisten and s6-svlisten1 now exit the number of
services that reported permanent failure. They exit 99 on timeout.
 - When a service has a ./nosetsid file that contains "setpgrp", it
is run in a new process group, but not in a new session. If the
./nosetsid file contains anything else, the service is run in the
same session and process group as the supervisor, and if there is
no such file, it's run in a new session (same behaviour as before).
 - s6-log now writes a warning to stderr when it closes the stdout
stream.
 - s6-log's individual file size limit bumped to 256 MB.
 - Various bugfixes. (thanks jjk!)
