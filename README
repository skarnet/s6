s6 - a process supervision suite
--------------------------------

 s6 is a suite of programs designed to allow process
supervision and management. It can also be used as the
foundation for a complete init system: the s6-rc and
s6-linux-init package, for instance, expand on it.

 See https://skarnet.org/software/s6/ for details.
