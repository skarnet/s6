This service reads from the "fifo" named pipe and logs
what it reads to the /tmp/uncaught-logs log directory.
The whole supervision tree has its stderr redirected to "fifo",
as well as services that do not have their own logger.
So, /tmp/uncaught-logs is the catch-all logger: logs that aren't
caught anywhere else end up there.

 You should create the "fifo" named pipe in this directory,
belonging to nobody:nogroup with rights 0622.
