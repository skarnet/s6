<h1> The s6-setsid program </h1>

<p>
 s6-setsid runs a program as a new session leader, or in a new
foreground or background process group.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-setsid [ -s | -b | -f | -g ] [ -i | -I | -q ] [ -d ctty ] <em>prog...</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> s6-setsid creates a new session, or a new process group,
and may make that process group the foreground process group,
depending on the options it has been given. </li>
 <li> As session leader or process group leader, s6-setsid then
executes into <em>prog...</em>. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-s</tt>&nbsp;: session. s6-setsid will try and execute
<em>prog</em> as a session leader. This is the default. </li>
 <li> <tt>-b</tt>&nbsp;: background process group. s6-setsid will
not create a new session, but will create a new process group, and
try and execute <em>prog</em> as the new process group leader. </li>
 <li> <tt>-f</tt>&nbsp;: foreground process group. s6-setsid will
not create a new session, but will create a new process group and
attach its session's controlling terminal to the new process group
before executing <em>prog</em>. However, the new process group
will likely be stopped, waiting for the former foreground process
group to relinquish the controlling terminal, and will need to be
sent a SIGCONT to resume. To avoid that, use the next option. </li>
 <li> <tt>-g</tt>&nbsp;: grab terminal. s6-setsid will
not create a new session, but will create a new process group and
attach its session's controlling terminal to the new process group
before executing <em>prog</em>. It will forcefully grab the controlling
terminal from the former foreground process group, which means that
a process belonging to the former foreground process group attempting
to read from or write to that terminal will be stopped. </li>
 <li> <tt>-i</tt>&nbsp;: strict. If s6-setsid cannot perform the
operations it needs, it will exit 111 with an error message. </li>
 <li> <tt>-I</tt>&nbsp;: loose. If s6-setsid cannot perform the operations,
it will print a warning message, but exec into <em>prog</em> nonetheless.
This is the default. </li>
 <li> <tt>-q</tt>&nbsp;: silent. s6-setsid will not print any warning
message; it will exec into <em>prog</em> even if it cannot perform the
operations. </li>
 <li> <tt>-d&nbsp;<em>ctty</em></tt>&nbsp;: assume <em>ctty</em> is
the controlling terminal for the current session. Default is 0.
This is only useful when used with the <tt>-f</tt> or
<tt>-g</tt> options. </li>
</ul>
