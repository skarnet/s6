<h1> The <tt>s6-ipcserver-access</tt> program </h1>

<p>
<tt>s6-ipcserver-access</tt> is a command-line access
control tool for Unix domain sockets on systems where the
<a href="http://www.superscript.com/ucspi-ipc/getpeereid.html">getpeereid()</a> system call can be implemented.
It is meant to be run after
<a href="s6-ipcserverd.html">s6-ipcserverd</a> and before
the application program on the s6-ipcserver command line.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-ipcserver-access [ -v <em>verbosity</em> ] [ -E | -e ] [ -l <em>localname</em> ] [ -i <em>rulesdir</em> | -x <em>rulesfile</em> ] <em>prog...</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> s6-ipcserver-access checks it is run under a UCSPI server tool
such as <a href="s6-ipcserver.html">s6-ipcserver</a>.
 <li> It checks that the remote end of the connection fits the
accepted criteria defined by the database contained in <em>rulesdir</em>
or <em>rulesfile</em>. If the database tells it to reject the connection,
the program exits 1. </li>
 <li> It sets up a few additional environment variables. </li>
 <li> It executes into <em>prog...</em>,
unless the first matching rule in the rule database
includes instructions to override <em>prog...</em>. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Environment variables </h2>

<p>
s6-ipcserver-access expects to inherit some environment variables from
its parent:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> PROTO: normally IPC, but could be anything else, like UNIX. </li>
 <li> ${PROTO}REMOTEEUID: the effective UID of the client program connecting to the socket. </li>
 <li> ${PROTO}REMOTEEGID: the effective GID of the client program connecting to the socket. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Additionally, it exports the following variables before executing into
<em>prog...</em>:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> ${PROTO}LOCALPATH: set to the local "address" of the socket, as
reported by the
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/functions/getsockname.html">getsockname()</a>
system call, truncated to 99 characters max. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Also, the access rules database can instruct s6-ipcserver-access to set
up, or unset, more environment variables, depending on the client address.
</p>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-v&nbsp;<em>verbosity</em></tt>&nbsp;: be more or less verbose, i.e.
print more or less information to stderr:
  <ul>
   <li> 0: only log error messages. </li>
   <li> 1: only log error and warning messages, and accepted connections.
This is the default. </li>
   <li> 2: also log rejected connections and more warning messages. </li>
  </ul> </li>
 <li> <tt>-E</tt>&nbsp;: no environment. All environment variables potentially
set by s6-ipcserver-access, as well as those set by
<a href="s6-ipcserver.html">s6-ipcserver</a>, will be unset instead. </li>
 <li> <tt>-e</tt>&nbsp;: set up environment variables normally.
This is the default. </li>
 <li> <tt>-l&nbsp;<em>localname</em></tt>&nbsp;: use <em>localname</em>
as the value for the ${PROTO}LOCALPATH environment variable, instead of
looking it up via getsockname(). </li>
 <li> <tt>-i&nbsp;<em>rulesdir</em></tt>&nbsp;: check client credentials
against a filesystem-based database in the <em>rulesdir</em> directory. </li>
 <li> <tt>-x&nbsp;<em>rulesfile</em></tt>&nbsp;: check client credentials
against a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdb_(software)">cdb</a>
database in the <em>rulesfile</em> file. <tt>-i</tt> and <tt>-x</tt> are
mutually exclusive. If none of those options is given, no credential checking will be
performed, and a warning will be emitted on every connection if
<em>verbosity</em> is 2 or more. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Access rule checking </h2>

<p>
 s6-ipcserver-access checks its client connection against
a ruleset. This ruleset can be implemented:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> either in the filesystem as an arborescence of directories and files,
if the <tt>-i</tt> option has been given. This option is the most flexible
one: the directory format is simple enough for scripts to understand and
modify it, and the ruleset can be changed dynamically. This is practical,
for instance, for roaming users. </li>
<li> or in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdb_(software)">CDB
file</a>, if the <tt>-x</tt> option has been given. This option is the most
efficient one if the ruleset is static enough: a lot less system calls are
needed to perform searches in a CDB than in the filesystem. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 The exact format of the ruleset is described on the
<a href="s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs.html">s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs</a> page.
</p>

<p>
s6-ipcserver-access first reads the client UID <em>uid</em> and
GID <em>gid</em> from the
${PROTO}REMOTEEUID and ${PROTO}REMOTEEGID environment variables, and checks
them with the
<a href="libs6/accessrules.html#uidgid">s6_accessrules_keycheck_uidgid()</a>
function. In other words, it tries to match:

<ul>
 <li> (if the client's effective uid is the same as <tt>s6-ipcserver-access</tt>'s effective uid) <tt>uid/self</tt> </li>
 <li> <tt>uid/</tt><em>uid</em> </li>
 <li> (if the client's effective gid is the same as <tt>s6-ipcserver-access</tt>'s effective gid) <tt>gid/self</tt> </li>
 <li> <tt>gid/</tt><em>gid</em> </li>
 <li> <tt>uid/default</tt> </li>
</ul>

<p>
 in that order. If no S6_ACCESSRULES_ALLOW result can be obtained,
the connection is denied.
</p>

<h2> Environment and executable modifications </h2>

<p>
 s6-ipcserver-access interprets non-empty <tt>env</tt> subdirectories
and <tt>exec</tt> files
it finds in the first matching rule of the ruleset, as explained
in the <a href="s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs.html">s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs</a>
page.
</p>

<ul>
 <li> An <tt>env</tt> subdirectory is interpreted as if the
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-envdir.html">s6-envdir</a>
command had been called before executing <em>prog</em>: the environment
is modified according to the contents of <tt>env</tt>. </li>
 <li> An <tt>exec</tt> file containing <em>newprog</em> completely
bypasses the rest of s6-ipcserver-access' command line. After
environment modifications, if any, s6-ipcserver-access execs into
<tt><a href="//skarnet.org/software/execline/execlineb.html">execlineb</a> -c <em>newprog</em></tt>.
Please be aware that the <tt>exec</tt> file functionality is only supported
when s6 has been built with execline support. Otherwise, a warning message
is printed and executable diversion is <em>not</em> performed. </li>
</ul>
