<h1> The <tt>s6-ipcserver-socketbinder</tt> program </h1>

<p>
<tt>s6-ipcserver-socketbinder</tt> binds a Unix domain
socket, then executes a program.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-ipcserver-socketbinder [ -d | -D ] [ -b <em>backlog</em> ] [ -M | -m ] [ -a <em>perms</em> ] [ -B ] <em>path</em> <em>prog...</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> s6-ipcserver-socketbinder creates a Unix domain socket
and binds it to <em>path</em>. It prepares the socket to accept
connections by calling
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/functions/listen.html">listen()</a>. </li>
 <li> It then execs into <em>prog...</em> with the open socket
as its standard input. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-d</tt>&nbsp;: allow instant rebinding to the same path
even if it has been used not long ago - this is the SO_REUSEADDR flag to
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/functions/setsockopt.html">setsockopt()</a>
and is generally used with server programs. This is the default. Note that
<em>path</em> will be deleted if it already exists at program start time. </li>
 <li> <tt>-D</tt>&nbsp;: disallow instant rebinding to the same path. </li>
 <li> <tt>-b&nbsp;<em>backlog</em></tt>&nbsp;: set a maximum of
<em>backlog</em> backlog connections on the socket - extra
connection attempts will rejected by the kernel. The default is SOMAXCONN,
i.e. the maximum number allowed by the system. If <em>backlog</em>
is 0, then the socket will be created, but it <strong>will not be
listening</strong>. </li>
 <li> <tt>-M</tt>&nbsp;: the type of the socket will be SOCK_STREAM. This is
the default. </li>
 <li> <tt>-m</tt>&nbsp;: the type of the socket will be SOCK_DGRAM. Note
that by default SOCK_DGRAM sockets are not connection-mode, and <tt>listen()</tt>
will fail - so you should always give the <tt>-b0</tt> option to
s6-ipcserver-socketbinder along with <tt>-m</tt>. </li>
 <li> <tt>-a&nbsp;<em>perms</em></tt>&nbsp;: create the socket with
permissions <em>perms</em>, which is an octal number from 0000 to 0777.
Default is 0777, meaning everyone can connect to it. 0700 means only processes having the
same uid as the s6-ipcserver-socketbinder process can connect to it. </li>
 <li> <tt>-B</tt>&nbsp;: the socket will be blocking. The default is nonblocking. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> The socket is provided <strong>non-blocking by default</strong>. </li>
 <li> s6-ipcserver-socketbinder is part of a set of basic blocks used to
build a flexible Unix super-server. It normally should be given a
command line crafted to make it execute into
<a href="s6-ipcserverd.html">s6-ipcserverd</a> to accept connections
from clients, or into a program such as
<a href="s6-applyuidgid.html">s6-applyuidgid</a>
to drop privileges before doing so. </li>
 <li> The <a href="s6-ipcserver.html">s6-ipcserver</a> program does
exactly this. It implements
a full Unix super-server by building a command line starting with
s6-ipcserver-socketbinder and ending with s6-ipcserverd followed by the
application program, and executing into it. </li>
</ul>
