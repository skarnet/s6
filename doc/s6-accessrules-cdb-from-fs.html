<h1> The <tt>s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs</tt> program </h1>

<p>
<tt>s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs</tt> compiles a directory
containing a ruleset suitable for
<a href="s6-ipcserver-access.html">s6-ipcserver-access</a> or
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/s6-tcpserver-access.html">s6-tcpserver-access</a> into a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdb_(software)">CDB file</a>.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs [ -m <em>mode</em> ] <em>cdbfile</em> <em>dir</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs compiles the <em>dir</em>
directory containing a ruleset into a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdb_(software)">CDB file</a>
<em>cdbfile</em> then exits 0. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-m&nbsp;<em>mode</em></tt>&nbsp;: create <em>cdbfile</em> with
permissions <em>mode</em> (an octal number). </li>
</ul>

<h2> Ruleset directory format </h2>

<p>
 To be understood by s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs,
<a href="s6-ipcserver-access.html">s6-ipcserver-access</a>, or
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/s6-tcpserver-access.html">s6-tcpserver-access</a>,
<em>dir</em> must have a specific format.
</p>

<p>
 <em>dir</em> contains a series of directories:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>ip4</tt> for rules on IPv4 addresses </li>
 <li> <tt>ip6</tt> for rules on IPv6 addresses </li>
 <li> <tt>reversedns</tt> for rules on host names </li>
 <li> <tt>uid</tt> for rules on user IDs </li>
 <li> <tt>gid</tt> for rules on group IDs </li>
</ul>

<p>
Depending on the application, other directories can appear in <em>dir</em>
and be compiled into <em>cdbfile</em>, but
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/s6-tcpserver-access.html">s6-tcpserver-access</a> only
uses the first three, and
<a href="s6-ipcserver-access.html">s6-ipcserver-access</a> only
uses the last two.
</p>

<p>
 Each of those directories contains a set of rules. A rule is
a subdirectory named after the set of keys it matches, and containing
actions that will be executed if the rule is the first matching rule
for the tested key.
</p>

<p>
 The syntax for the rule name is dependent on the nature of keys, and
fully documented on the
<a href="libs6/accessrules.html">accessrules</a>
library page. For instance, a subdirectory named <tt>192.168.0.0_27</tt>
in the <tt>ip4</tt> directory will match every IPv4 address in the
192.168.0.0/27 network that does not match a more precise rule.
</p>

<p>
 The syntax for the actions, however, is the same for every type of key.
A rule subdirectory can contain the following elements:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> a file (that can be empty) named <tt>allow</tt>. If such a file exists,
a key matching this rule will be immediately accepted. </li>
 <li> a file (that can be empty) named <tt>deny</tt>. If such a file exists and
no <tt>allow</tt> file exists, a key matching this rule will be immediately
denied. </li>
 <li> a subdirectory named <tt>env</tt>. If such a directory exists along
with an <tt>allow</tt> file, then its contents represent environment
modifications that will be applied after accepting the connection and
before executing the next program in the chain, as if the
<a href="s6-envdir.html">s6-envdir</a>
program, without options, was applied to <tt>env</tt>. <tt>env</tt>
has exactly the same format as a directory suitable for s6-envdir;
however, if the modifications take up more than 4096 bytes when
compiled into <em>cdbfile</em>, then s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs will
complain and exit 100. </li>
 <li> a file named <tt>exec</tt>. If such a file exists along with an
<tt>allow</tt> file, then its contents represent a command line that,
interpreted by the
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/execline/execlineb.html">execlineb</a>
launcher, will be executed after accepting the connection, totally bypassing the
original command line. s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs truncates the <tt>exec</tt>
file to 4096 bytes max when embedding it into <em>cdbfile</em>, so make
sure it is not larger than that. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <em>cdbfile</em> can exist prior to, and during, the compilation,
which actually works in a temporary file in the same directory as
<em>cdbfile</em> and performs an atomic replacement when it is done.
So it is not necessary to interrupt a running service during the
compilation. </li>
 <li> If s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs fails at some point, the temporary
file is removed. However, this doesn't happen if
s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs is interrupted by a signal. </li>
 <li> After the program successfully completes, if <em>dir</em>
was a suitable candidate for the <tt>-i</tt> option of
<a href="s6-ipcserver-access.html">s6-ipcserver-access</a> or
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/s6-tcpserver-access.html">s6-tcpserver-access</a>, then
<em>cdbfile</em> will be a suitable candidate for the <tt>-x</tt> option
of the same program, implementing the same ruleset. </li>
 <li> <em>cdbfile</em> can be decompiled by the
<a href="s6-accessrules-fs-from-cdb.html">s6-accessrules-fs-from-cdb</a>
program. </li>
</ul>
