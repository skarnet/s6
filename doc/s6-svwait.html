<h1> The s6-svwait program </h1>

<p>
s6-svwait blocks until a collection of supervised services goes up, or down.
</p>

<p>
s6-svwait only waits for notifications; it never polls.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-svwait [ -U | -u | -d ] [ -a | -o ] [ -t <em>timeout</em> ] <em>servicedir...</em>
</pre>

<p>
s6-svwait monitors one or more <a href="servicedir.html">service
directories</a> given as its arguments, waiting for a state (up or down) to
happen. It exits 0 when the wanted condition becomes true.
</p>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-u</tt>&nbsp;: up. s6-svwait will wait until the services are up, as
reported by s6-supervise.
This is the default; it is not reliable, but it does not depend on specific
support in the service programs. See <a href="notifywhenup.html">this page</a>
for details. </li>
 <li> <tt>-U</tt>&nbsp;: really up. s6-svwait will wait until the services are
up, as reported by the services themselves. This requires specific support in the
service programs: see the explanation on <a href="notifywhenup.html">this page</a>. </li>
 <li> <tt>-d</tt>&nbsp;: down. s6-svwait will wait until the services are down. </li>
 <li> <tt>-o</tt>&nbsp;: or. s6-svwait will wait until <em>one</em> of the
given services comes up or down. </li>
 <li> <tt>-a</tt>&nbsp;: and. s6-svwait will wait until <em>all</em> of the
given services come up or down. This is the default. </li>
 <li> <tt>-t <em>timeout</em></tt>&nbsp;: if the requested events have not
happened after <em>timeout</em> milliseconds, s6-svwait will print a message
to stderr and exit 1. By default, <em>timeout</em> is 0, which means no time
limit. </li>
</ul>


<h2> Internals </h2>

<p>
s6-svwait spawns a <a href="s6-ftrigrd.html">s6-ftrigrd</a> child to
listen to notifications sent by <a href="s6-supervise.html">s6-supervise</a>.
It also checks <tt>supervise/status</tt> files to get the current service
states, so it is immune to race conditions.
