<h1> The <tt>s6-fdholder</tt> error codes </h1>

<p>
 The following error messages (and corresponding
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/basedefs/errno.h.html">errno codes</a>)
can be returned by the
<a href="s6-fdholderd.html">s6-fdholderd</a> daemon to its various clients.
This page explains why they occur.
</p>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>Protocol error</tt> (EPROTO) or <tt>Protocol wrong type
for socket</tt> (EPROTOTYPE): the client connected to the wrong
kind of server and they cannot communicate. This is generally a
programming error. It can also
signal a bug in the s6-fdholder tools, but protocol bugs have
usually been wiped out before an s6 release. </li>
 <li> <tt>Broken pipe</tt> (EPIPE): the client was not authorized to
connect to the server, which closed the connection. You need to
<a href="s6-fdholderd.html#configuration">configure the access
rights to the server</a>. </li>
 <li> <tt>Operation not permitted</tt> (EPERM): even though the
client was authorized to connect to the server, the specific
operation it wanted to perform was denied. You need to
<a href="s6-fdholderd.html#configuration">configure the access
rights to the server</a>. </li>
 <li> <tt>Too many open files in system</tt> (ENFILE): the client
attempted to store more file descriptors than the server can hold.
Or, the client attempted to retrieve more file descriptors than it
can hold. You should check the <tt>-n</tt> option to
<a href="s6-fdholderd.html">s6-fdholderd</a>, as well as the
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/basedefs/sys_resource.h.html">RLIMIT_NOFILE</a>
resource limits used by the client and the server, and adjust them
accordingly. </li>
 <li> <tt>Resource busy</tt> (EBUSY): the client attempted to store
a descriptor under an identifier that is already used. </li>
 <li> <tt>Filename too long</tt> (ENAMETOOLONG): the identifier
provided by the client was too long. </li>
 <li> <tt>No such file or directory</tt> (ENOENT): the identifier
provided by the client was not found in the server database. </li>
 <li> <tt>Bad file descriptor</tt> (EBADF): the client attempted
to transmit a closed, or otherwise unsuitable for fd-passing,
file descriptor. </li>
 <li> <tt>Operation timed out</tt> (ETIMEDOUT): the client, or the
server, took too long to perform the wanted operation. This is most
probably a programming error, because both client and server should
have a very fast reaction time. Check that the client is connecting
to the right server, and check <tt>-t</tt> options to both client and
server (the argument is interpreted as milliseconds!). </li>
 <li> Other errors indicate a transient error such as lack of memory,
hardware failure, etc. </li>
</ul>
